
Question 1) Difference between Linear and non-Linear data structure

Answer :-

(1)Linear Data Structure

-->In a linear data structure, data elements are arranged in a 
   linear order where each and every element is attached to its 
   previous and next adjacent.
-->In linear data structure, single level is involved.
-->Its implementation is easy in comparison to non-linear 
   data structure.
-->	In linear data structure, data elements can be traversed 
   in a single run only.
-->In a linear data structure, memory is not 
   utilized in an efficient way.
-->Its examples are: array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
-->Applications of linear data structures are mainly 
   in application software development.

(2)Non-Linear Data Structure

-->In a non-linear data structure, data elements are 
   attached in hierarchically manner.
-->Whereas in non-linear data structure, multiple levels are involved.
-->While its implementation is complex in comparison to linear data structure.
-->While in non-linear data structure, data elements canâ€™t be traversed in a single run only.
-->While in a non-linear data structure, memory is utilized in an efficient way. 
-->While its examples are: trees and graphs.
-->Applications of non-linear data structures are in Artificial Intelligence and image processing.
